# Local-Storage-API-Reponse-Wrapper

## Benefit:

This script allows you to freely manipulate and test data from both of your APIs without spamming them, you only have to call the APIs once.

## How-to-use:

Enter correct API URLs on lines 16 and 21 <br>
Then the program will place that API response into local storage once and only once, from there the API can be accessed from local storage. <br>
Then inside of the main void function (line 29) you can freely experiment with your API response, without calling the API again everytime you have to reload the page

## Example:
In this example I use the weather API from the last homework as my 2nd API, then I can manipulate it as much as I want in main, and eventually display data on my webpage:
